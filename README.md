# **Jetpack Compose Weather App**

My weather app, built with Kotlin, use **jetpack compose** and material 3 for design.


### Technology
- Dagger hilt for dependency injection
- Viewmodel to control Ui
- DataStore to save small value
- coroutine to handle asychronouse task
- Gson for JSON serialization
- Navigation
- Retrofit use alongside okhttp for network interceptor

For weather data, I use Weatherbit and Openweathermap api
